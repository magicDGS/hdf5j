/**
 * Superblock interface for Superbloc. Note that the Format Signature is not included in
 * this layout, because it is represented by the constant
 * {@link org.magicdgs.hdf5j.HDF5Constants#FORMAT_SIGNATURE}.
 *
 * <p>The superblock may begin at certain predefined offsets within the HDF5 file, allowing a block
 * of unspecified content for users to place additional information at the beginning (and end) of
 * the HDF5 file without limiting the HDF5 Library’s ability to manage the objects within the file
 * itself. This feature was designed to accommodate wrapping an HDF5 file in another file format or
 * adding descriptive information to an HDF5 file without requiring the modification of the actual
 * file’s information. The superblock is located by searching for the HDF5 format signature at byte
 * offset 0, byte offset 512, and at successive locations in the file, each a multiple of two of
 * the previous location; in other words, at these byte offsets: 0, 512, 1024, 2048, and so on.
 *
 * <p>The superblock is composed of the format signature, followed by a superblock version number
 * and information that is specific to each version of the superblock.
 *
 * <p>Currently, there are four versions of the superblock format:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>Version 0 is the default format.</li>
 *
 * <li>Version 1 is the same as version 0 but with the “Indexed Storage Internal Node K” field for
 * storing non-default B-tree ‘K’ value.</li>
 *
 * <li>Version 2 has some fields eliminated and compressed from superblock format versions 0 and 1.
 * It has added checksum support and superblock extension to store additional superblock
 * metadata.</li>
 *
 * <li>Version 3 is the same as version 2 except that the field “File Consistency Flags” is used
 * for file locking. This format version will enable support for the latest version.</li>
 *
 * </ul>

 * @implNote all byte/short fields returns an {@link int} because they are represented as unsigned
