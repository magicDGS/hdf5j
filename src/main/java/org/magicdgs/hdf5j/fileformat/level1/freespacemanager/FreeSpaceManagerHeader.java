/**
 * Free-space Manager Header interface (level 1H). Note that the Format Signature is a constant

 *
 * <p>Free-space managers are used to describe space within a heap or the entire HDF5 file that is
 * not currently used for that heap or file.
 *
 * <p>The free-space manager header contains metadata information about the space being tracked,
 * along with the address of the list of free space sections which actually describes the free
 * space. The header records information about free-space sections being tracked, creation
 * parameters for handling free-space sections of a client, and section information used to locate
 * the collection of free-space sections.
